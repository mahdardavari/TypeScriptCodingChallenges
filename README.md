Tips and Tricks:

Follow Consistent Naming Conventions
Adhere to consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes to improve code readability.
Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the entity.

Break down your code into smaller modules, each responsible for a specific functionality.
This promotes reusability and maintainability.

Add comments to explain complex algorithms, important decisions, or edge cases.
Avoid excessive comments that merely restate the code!
